//This second example is a test if the demagnetising field is implemented correctly
//To check this, we let 2 particles relax in the presence of an external field
//and check the output versus mumax. We also do the same simulation without
//calculating the demagnetising field to see if this problem is suited to 
//check the implementation; i.e. to see that it makes a difference.
